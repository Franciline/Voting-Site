# Voting-Site
Group project made in L2
The goal is to create a site where the user can simulate a voting election, and check the results based on different voting methods

Modules used:
Flask, SQLite3

Languages used:
Python, HTML, JS, CSS

My main role in this project was to link the python functions used to calculate the winner of an election and the WebSite. I used SQLite3 to save on a database the candidates generated, and manipulated it using Flask.
